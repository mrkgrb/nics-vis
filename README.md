# nics-vis
Pythons for the preparation of Gaussian inputs for NICS calculations and visualization of the results.

CAUTION: This method and the associated scripts have been tested only for linearly fused polycyclic π-systems (e.g., acenes, phenacenes, DPND, xanthene, fluorene dyes). They are not recommended for branched or pericondensed systems such as coronene, pyrene, or similar architectures.

# nics2d.py 
This script generates coordinates and Gaussian input files for NICS(h)zz 2D calculations (NICS maps) 
for all molecular *.xyz files in the working directory. The file template.gjf is used to provide the 
Gaussian keywords and settings. 

For each geometry, it identifies the longest fused polycyclic system and aligns it with the xy plane and along the x axis. The script is designed for bent and twisted π-systems: it creates grids of Bq points elevated by h above and below the ring planes of the fused system, perpendicular to them. 

After the Gaussian calculations, use the companion script nics_map.py to extract the results and produce 
visual 2D NICS maps.

For usage:
python nics2d.py --help

# nics_map.py and nics_map2.py
This script generates 2D NICS maps (PNG format) from Gaussian *.log files in the working directory.  
Log files must contain the string "NMP" in their filename and should originate from input files generated 
by the nics2d.py script.
nics_map2.py - enables saving only maps without axes.  
Log filenames should follow the format (as generated by nics2d.py):
[compound name]-[solvent abbreviation]-NMP.log for singlet or -tNMP.log for triplet state
e.g.: Pentacene-DCM-NMP.log

The script automatically corrects NICS(h)zz values for tilted rings by rotating the magnetic shielding tensor.  

Usage:
    python nics_map.py --help

# nics_solv.py and nics_solv2.py
This script generates differential 2D NICS maps (PNG format) for compounds in either:  
    • two selected solvents, or  
    • singlet (S0) vs. triplet (T1) states.  
nics_solv2.py - enables saving only maps without axes.
It detects suitable pairs of Gaussian *.log files in the working directory.  
Log files must contain the string "NMP" and should originate from input files generated by nics2d.py.  

For solvent differential maps, the filenames must include solvent abbreviations:  
    "DCM"  – dichloromethane  
    "ACN"  – acetonitrile  
    "Hex"  – n-hexane  
    "H2O"  – water  
    "MeOH" – methanol  
    "Tol"  – toluene  
    "Vac"  – vacuum  

The script automatically corrects NICS(h)zz values for tilted rings by rotating the magnetic shielding tensor.  

For singlet–triplet differential maps, filenames must contain `NMP` (singlet) and `tNMP` (triplet):  
    [compound name]-[solvent abbreviation]-NMP.log     → singlet (S0)  
    [compound name]-[solvent abbreviation]-tNMP.log    → triplet (T1)  
Example: Pentacene-DCM-NMP.log and Pentacene-DCM-tNMP.log  
→ generates a singlet–triplet differential map.  

For solvent differential maps, example:  
    Pentacene-Hex-NMP.log and Pentacene-MeOH-NMP.log  
→ generates a Hex–MeOH differential map (default pair).  

Other solvent pairs can be specified with `--sv1` and `--sv2` using the abbreviations above, e.g.:  
    python nics_solv.py --sv1 "DCM" --sv2 "H2O"  
→ generates a DCM–H2O differential map.
